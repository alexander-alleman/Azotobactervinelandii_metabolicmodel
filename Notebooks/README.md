# Juptyer or R-markdown notebooks for all curation, analysis, and figure creation


- **Annotation.ipynb**: Initial annotation of iDT1278 model and cleaning of model for manual curation work
- **Model Curation and Annotation.ipynb**: Manual curation of model to include electron transport enzymes as well as clean the model of extra reactions, loops, and poor annotations.
- **Rnf_stoich.ipynb**: A companion document that details the thermodynamics of the enzyme Rnf and proposed stoichiometry.
